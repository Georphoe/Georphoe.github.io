      <p>
        Welcome to my portfolio website, which I built during the summer of
        2023! This website showcases my skills in software development, website
        development, and data visualization, while providing a flexible and
        expandable platform to present my portfolio, services, and contact
        information. The primary audience for this portfolio website is
        employers seeking individuals with computer science skills. By
        showcasing my work and capabilities, I aim to demonstrate my proficiency
        in software development, web development, and data visualization,
        attracting potential job opportunities. Rest assured that this website
        will be regularly updated with new additions to further exemplify my
        evolving skills and showcase my latest projects.
      </p>
      <img src="./img/portfolio-01-details-01.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, combining these
        technologies to create a seamless user experience. The HTML structure is
        organized into individual sections, including a header, introduction,
        services, about me, my work, and a footer. Each section is beautifully
        styled using CSS to enhance visual appeal and usability. This approach
        allows visitors to navigate through the website easily and gain a
        comprehensive understanding of my background, skills, and achievements.
        As I continue to refine and expand my portfolio, this website will serve
        as a captivating gateway to witness my ongoing growth and the
        exceptional work I produce in software development, web development, and
        data visualization.
      </p>

      <p>
        To ensure a strong foundation to build this website, I completed various
        online courses, including "Learn HTML and CSS," "Learn JavaScript," and
        "Build and Deploy Your Portfolio" on Scrimba. These courses equipped me
        with the necessary knowledge and skills to create a polished and
        professional portfolio website. I invite you to explore my portfolio,
        learn more about the services I offer, and get in touch with me using
        the provided contact information. Thank you for visiting, and I look
        forward to connecting with you soon! Keep checking back for updates as I
        regularly enhance this platform with new projects, demonstrating my
        continuous dedication to honing my craft and delivering exceptional web,
        software, and data solutions.

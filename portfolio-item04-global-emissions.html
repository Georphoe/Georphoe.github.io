        Project Title: Total Emissions Per Country (2000-2020) and Any
        Correlation Found Between
      </p>
      <p>
        This project aims to analyze and visualize the total emissions of each
        country from the year 2000 through 2020. The dataset includes the total
        amount of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2)
        emissions by each country for every year. By visualizing this data, we
        were able to observe the trend of emissions over the years, identify the
        country with the fastest-growing rate of emissions, and determine the
        country with the highest emissions.
      </p>
      <img src="./img/portfolio-04-details-01.png" alt="" />

      <p>
        The data used in the project is obtained from Kaggle
        (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/justin2028/total-emissions-per-country-2000-2020),
        and the original data source is the United Nations' Food and Agriculture
        Organization (FAO) website. This dataset includes five attributes,
        58,766 rows, and 25 columns. The five attributes are: Area (Country),
        Item (Source of Emission), Element (Type of Emission), Unit (Emissions =
        kilotons), and Year (Each Year from 2000-2020).
      </p>
      <img src="./img/portfolio-04-details-02.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        My visualization project contains four charts: a line chart for each
        country's emissions over time, a pie chart of the top ten countries with
        the highest emissions and their percentages compared to the world's
        emissions, a bar chart of the highest growth, and an interactive heatmap
        showing the emissions of each country. These charts aim to help the
        viewer explore the data by considering different factors such as year,
        country, and growth rate, etc.

      <p>
        Throughout this tableau project on "Total Emissions Per Country
        (2000-2020) and Any Correlation Found Between," I have gained valuable
        skills in data analysis and visualization. By working with a large
        dataset and utilizing Tableau's tools and features, I have enhanced my
        ability to extract insights from complex data and present them in a
        clear and meaningful way.
      </p>
      <img src="./img/portfolio-04-details-04.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        One of the key skills I have developed is data cleaning and
        preprocessing, as I had to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the
        dataset before visualizing it. This involved handling missing values,
        standardizing units, and organizing the data into a format suitable for
        analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, I have honed my data visualization skills by creating
        various charts, including line charts, pie charts, bar charts, and an
        interactive heatmap. Through careful selection of chart types, color
        schemes, and labeling, I have effectively conveyed information and
        allowed viewers to explore the data from different perspectives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, I have gained proficiency in analyzing trends, identifying
        patterns, and drawing conclusions from the visualizations. By examining
        the emissions over time, comparing different countries, and considering
        factors such as growth rates and emission policies, I have developed a
        deeper understanding of the dataset and its implications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, this tableau project has equipped me with valuable skills in
        data analysis, data visualization, and critical thinking. It has
        provided me with a practical application of data exploration and
        presentation, which will undoubtedly be beneficial in future projects
        and endeavors.
